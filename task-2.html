      <h2>Tribute to Dr BR Ambedkar-saheb on his death anniversary</h2>
      <p>
        On 6 December 1956, India lost a great soul and a legendary figure who
        passed away at his home in Delhi, he was none other than Dr Bhimrao
        Ramji Ambedkar, (Dr B.R. Ambedkar) popularly known as
        Babasaheb/Ambedkar-saheb. Dr Babasaheb was born on 14 April 1891; the
        day in many parts of the country is celebrated as New Year. Time to time
        many genius persons were born in India and all were not born with a
        silver spoon as many of them had to struggle in their life owing to
        economic, social and other conditions. Dr B.R. Ambedkar was one such
        person who had to fight in his life because of social stigma, not
        economic. With his knowledge, wisdom and humanitarian feelings he had
        proved by caste one cannot be great and one can be great only by deeds.
        He was jurist, economist, politician, social reformer, prolific writer
        and sociologist as a sequel he could reach to the zenith of intellectual
        excellence. Also, he was the architect of our constitution for which we
        all are proud as almost same time Pakistan was created but within 25
        years East Pakistan became Bangladesh and several times Army rule was
        observed in Pakistan.
